# Homework 02
This is my deployed student bio webpage. I used Bootstrap to create a responsive site where you can check out some of my creative work, fill out a contact form and get to know me a little better!

## Built With
* [Bootstrap] (https://getbootstrap.com/) - I didn't use an external CSS sheet for this, I only used Bootstrap and HTML.

### Acknowledgements
* (https://codepen.io/csshint/pen/EQLwrM) - I used parts of this code to create a cool contact form
